#How to follow this TDD case study 
* Read the class comments on each Spec class (in the order the classes are listed). 
* Consider the following points:

#Functionality starts simple and becomes complicated
* Compare VaCalculateCaloriesFunctionalSpec:26 to VzCalculateCaloriesFinal:6-20
 
#With or without specs? 
* With specs, implementation is documented, and can be refactored and maintained.
* Without specs, implementation becomes unmaintainable (imagine first implementation patched to implement last implementation) and undocumented.
